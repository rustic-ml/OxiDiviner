1. **Multi-Strategy Model Selection**:
   - Fixed model selection
   - Performance-based automatic selection
   - Regime-dependent model mapping
   - Ensemble with configurable weighting

2. **Real-Time Quality Monitoring**:
   - Rolling window calculations
   - Trend analysis with linear regression
   - Automatic fallback triggering
   - Comprehensive quality scoring

3. **Adaptive Parameters**:
   - Learning rate configuration (0.01-1.0)
   - Adaptation window sizing (10+ observations)
   - Confidence thresholds (0.0-1.0)
   - Frequency limits for stability

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive validation with descriptive error messages
- Graceful degradation when quality drops
